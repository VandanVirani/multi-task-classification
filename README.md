# multi-task-classification

In this project we are going to train a neural network using tensorflow on data set MNIST
and get the prediction not only sign but also the colour of the data set

--  we know MNIST dataset is collections of colourless images, but we want to learn multi task classification, so
we will add colour to each images and prediction sign as well as colour of the image
-- for making simple we use only
